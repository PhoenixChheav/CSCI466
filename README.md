# CSCI466 - Databases
This is my Databases class in Spring 2024.
I have learnt about ER Diagram, database concepts, html, php and sql.
After midterm we do not have any lecture since we start doing group project. My group and I have called it KaraFun. 
This project does not focus on interfaces, but as the class title, database, so we do not really implement a good interface since we have only a few weeks left and sp we mainly focus on database.
But this repo contain only the assignments, I am including the project in a different repo.
